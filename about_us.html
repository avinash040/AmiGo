<b>Project proposal: Social Commerce Platform for UOttawa (pilot)</b>
</br>
<b>a. Title</b>
</br>
<b>AmiGo</b>
</br>
<b>b. Executive summary</b>
<p>
As an initial phase AmiGo is intended to be a business to business (B2B) application that could let
any university or corporation to have a private platform where students or employees can advertise
rideshare details. The business in the future could be extended further in enabling tutoring services,
selling tickets, etc (Next Phase).
</p>
<b>c. Introduction (An overview)</b>
<p>
AmiGO intends to provide a platform where active students or staff can share their rideshare details
in a safer way. The main idea is to let users decide if the person offering the service is trustworthy
or not on their own basis of past reviews and feedback. As a first stage, AmiGO will provide the
platform to the University by unanimously establishing a B2B business model and such service
would be completely overt and transparent where details are explicitly outlined relating to the
destination location, pick-up location, approximate travel time, details of the person offering
rideshare etc. The service is intended to be deployed as a web application first and then as a mobile
application to target a greater number of audiences based on the initial response.
</p>
<b>d. Area of exploration</b>
<p>
Industry: Peer to Peer service sharing
Problem identified: We would like to create a business in the online classified advertising category
since most students who try to find rideshares must post their ad on an unknown e-commerce
platform. The problem with these external commerce services is that there is no verified information
from the advertiser and/or the buyer like the ones we have seen in more recent apps (such as in
Airbnb). By allowing our users to comment and by understanding their rating habits, we intend to
find a solution to improve the future commerce environment.
</p>
<b>e. Planned solution</b> 
<p>
Many students/employees using current services such as Kijiji see that some rideshares are
intermittently cancelled, and also are not verified by the person posting the ad. We see a market
opportunity here. The main idea for this proposal would be to create an E-commerce classified
application only for the university students in order to help them save money and to address the
problem of the uncontrolled system of identity verification within the public web. The creation of a
personal profile would be restricted to people with their active uOttawa email addresses and, as we
mentioned before, these profiles could have a service rating system or feedback after the rideshare.
Hence, the value proposition of the product is providing a safe environment for posting and
consuming services. The payment could be linked to the student’s campus card account or shown

from the beginning of the semester as an additional “fee” from their tuition charges like an annual
subscription. Initially, our company’s revenue could come from the university’s payments as a
subscription fee, similar to Brightspace.
This way information posted using our official forum would be more authentic and secure for them.
Also, the advertising persons profile can be reviewed and rated by the students using the platform.
The university can integrate the uPass payment system with the application, and let the users use
that instead of cash or credit card. In certain circumstances such as when there is a bus strike
(happened in 2009), the university can subsidize the platform as it has control over it.
As we mentioned before, the planned solution is to create the core business in the B2B category
instead of creating a regular B2C public classified site, such as Kijiji, Facebook, etc - this gives us
a competitive advantage. The support of the official channel such as the University or a corporation
would also help us create a friendlier and private commerce environment.
The market strategy would be to start a pilot project with the University of Ottawa, then expand
to other universities and corporations. We will also gradually add additional services such as
tutoring to the platform. Initially, to attract more users, we could provide some free credit to their
account. We will also aggressively advertise the product in the uOttawa’s social media and
community hotspots. In terms of organizational development, we have a technical team to develop
the product and a marketing team for our strategic approach with customers to get feedback from
them.
</p>
<b>f. The expected outcome:</b> 
<p>To create a monitored peer to peer ridesharing platform that enables
secure transportation. The business can then be scaled across multiple corporations and universities,
also offering services in addition to ride sharing. Since the technical development effort is very
similar, we could pivot and eventually have a Business to customer (B2C) application whereas the
service providers, we would take responsibility for the entire platform, but also restrict the use to
specific environments to have a trustworthy environment.
